The background file is a particle background count map. So it doesn't need to be vignetting corrected. The unit
of background profile is always "cts/s/arcmin^2"
The exposure map should include vignetting correction information and can have different kinds of
unit e.g. "s", "s*cm^2".
flux = (count - scaled_bkg) / exp

In this module, there are two background scaling methods. One is only using a scaling factor to scale the
background count number. Another one is using a scaling factor to scale the count rate. In the second
way, an EXPOSURE keyword is needed in the background file header.
