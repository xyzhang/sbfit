# Regions

## Region format
The `sbfit` package supports [DS9](https://ds9.si.edu) format region files. 
Each region file should contain one [inclusive](#inclusive-regions) region 
and any number of [exclusive](#exclusive-regions) regions.
Currently, only the `image`, `fk5`, and `icrs` frames are supported.

## Include/exclude property
Different from the original Include/Exclude property of the DS9 regions, the 
`sbfit` package defines this property based on the type of the regions. The 
description of each region type can be found at 
<http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html>.

### Inclusive regions
Inclusive regions are used to extract a surface brightness profile. They
are:

- `panda` 
- `epanda` 
- `projection`

---
**NOTE**

For regions `panda` and `epanda`, the numbers of angles and radii should be 
set to 1.

### Exlcusive regions
Exclusive regions are used for masking sources. They are:

- `circle`
- `ellipse`
