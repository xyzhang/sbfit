This package is motivated by the precursor 
[PyXel](https://github.com/gogrean/PyXel). The aim of this package is to 
provide a lightweight, Python based, and extensible tool for daily X-ray 
imaging analysis. The author thanks Aurora Simionescu for introducing PyXel; 
thanks Jelle de Plaa for guidance on software packaging and documentation.
